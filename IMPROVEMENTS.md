This document outlines a prioritized plan to improve the mobile experience of the `WatchPage.js` component.  The plan is broken down into phases for easier implementation. Make sure you are not making any changes related to video in Videosection.js component as it fetched videoplayer from iframe. 

**Overall Goal:** Optimize the `WatchPage` for mobile devices (phones and smaller tablets), prioritizing a smooth, intuitive, and visually appealing experience.

**Phase 1: Core Layout & Responsiveness (High Priority)**

This phase focuses on fundamental structural changes to ensure the page adapts gracefully to smaller screens.

* **Task 1:  Switch to Primarily Vertical Layout (Highest Priority):**
    * Replace the `grid` layout (especially in the main content area) with `flex-col` for a vertical stacking. This is crucial for preventing horizontal scrolling on mobile.
    *  Adjust Tailwind CSS classes to ensure elements stack neatly, even on very small screens.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** No horizontal scrolling on any mobile device.  All content is vertically stacked and easily accessible.

* **Task 2: Optimize Video Player Placement & Size (High Priority):**
    * Ensure the video player occupies the full width (`w-full`) of the screen on mobile.
    * Maintain aspect ratio to avoid distortion.  Use appropriate aspect-ratio classes in Tailwind.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Video player always fills the available horizontal space while maintaining aspect ratio.

* **Task 3: Re-order Content Vertically (High Priority):**
    *  Prioritize content order for mobile: Video Player, Title/Metadata, Episode Selection (if applicable), Recommendations,  Other Sections (cast, crew, reviews).  Less important sections may be hidden initially via a tab or accordion.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear and logical vertical flow of information; easy to scan and consume on mobile.

* **Task 4:  Refactor Source Selector and Download (Medium Priority):**
    * Move the source selector and download button to a less prominent location, potentially into a dropdown or settings menu.  Reduce visual clutter on smaller screens.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Source selection and download options are still available but less visually intrusive on smaller screens.

**Phase 2:  Enhancements and Refinements (Medium Priority)**

This phase focuses on improving the user experience with interactive elements and better design patterns.

* **Task 5: Increase Touch Target Sizes (High Priority):**
    * Increase the size of buttons, sliders, and other interactive elements, especially the Source Selector, to improve usability on touchscreens. Utilize Tailwind's responsive modifiers.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** All interactive elements are easily tappable with a finger on mobile.


* **Task 6: Improve Episode Navigation (High Priority if applicable):**
    *  If the application has many episodes, consider using a list view or a compact grid view for episode selection.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Episode selection is efficient and easy to use on mobile devices, regardless of the number of episodes.


* **Task 7: Optimize Background Poster (Medium Priority):**
    * Consider removing the blurred background poster on lower-end mobile devices to improve performance. Use a conditional render.
    * Consider using a less resource-intensive background image.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Background image is optional, based on the user agent or device detection. Performance is improved on slower devices.


**Phase 3:  Performance and User Experience (Low Priority - but Important)**

This phase addresses performance considerations and overall UX improvements.

* **Task 8: Lazy Loading of Images and Content (High Priority):**
    * Implement lazy loading for images and other content that appears below the fold to reduce initial load times.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Significant performance improvements on slower mobile networks.


* **Task 9:  Fullscreen Mode Optimization (Medium Priority):**
    * Thoroughly test fullscreen mode on various mobile devices and browsers.  Address any layout issues or inconsistencies.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Fullscreen mode works reliably and looks good on all tested mobile devices and browsers.



This phased approach allows for incremental progress, facilitating testing and validation at each stage.  Prioritize tasks within each phase based on user impact and feasibility.
