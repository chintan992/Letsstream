# Project Improvements

## Accessibility Enhancements
- Add `aria-labels` to important elements for better screen reader support.
- Ensure that color contrasts meet accessibility standards.

## SEO Improvements
- Use semantic HTML elements (like `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.) for better SEO and structure.

## Performance Optimization
- Consider using React's `memo` for the `Support` component if it receives props in the future to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Styling Consistency
- Ensure consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for better maintainability.

## Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries or fallback UI in case of issues with rendering.

## Dynamic Content
- Consider fetching FAQs from an API or a JSON file to make the content dynamic and easier to update.

## User Feedback
- Add a feedback mechanism for users to submit their questions or suggestions directly from the support page.
