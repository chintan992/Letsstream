# <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Let's Stream</mark>

The <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Let's Stream</mark> Website project aims to create a website that uses <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Streaming API</mark> to fetch video URLs and implements the <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">TMDB API</mark> to fetch movies and series data. It also includes a recommendation engine in <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Python</mark> that recommends the user's next movie or series to watch based on their recently played movies and series. The project will have a basic <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">iframe</mark> implementation of <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Streaming API</mark> using a form to get the movies and series data, which is implemented in <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">React</mark> and deployed on <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Netlify</mark>. The team is planning to switch the whole project to <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Cloudflare Pages</mark> for the front-end and serverless functions to run on <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Cloudflare Workers</mark>. They will also make a recommendation engine in <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Node.js</mark> or <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">Python</mark>, whichever is easier to implement with the current prospect.

## Future Goals

1. **User profiles:** Create user profiles that store their recently played movies and series, their preferences, and their watch history. This will allow the recommendation engine to provide more personalized recommendations based on the user’s viewing habits.
2. Social media integration: Allow users to share their favorite movies and series on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This will help to increase the website’s visibility and attract more users.
3. **Advanced search:** Implement an advanced search feature that allows users to search for movies and series based on various criteria such as genre, year of release, rating, and more.
4. **User reviews and ratings:** Allow users to rate and review movies and series. This will help other users to decide whether or not to watch a particular movie or series.
5. **Multiple languages:** Add support for multiple languages to make the website accessible to a wider audience.
6. **Mobile app:** Develop a mobile app for the Let’s Stream Website project. This will allow users to access the website on their mobile devices and watch movies and series on the go.
7. **Live streaming:** Add support for live streaming of events such as movie premieres, award shows, and more. This will help to attract more users to the website and increase engagement.
8. **Subscription model:** Implement a subscription model that allows users to access premium content such as exclusive movies and series. This will help to generate revenue for the website and provide users with more options.
